# babycam
OpenSource implementation of iBaby M2/ M3/ M3S network protocol. It can also work on other cameras. You can use in two ways either by replacing orignal application on camera itself or by impersonating clients.

## Client application impersonation
There are two clients (camera2.py and camera3.py) for both Python 2 and Python 3. Once client is executed it connects to camera and starts dumping frames to out.jpg file which for example can be hosted via regular HTTP server. I attach very simple example of HTML file that refreshes image and can work on any device. To start you simply edit the source of camera2/camera3 and start it like this:
```
./camera3.py
```

Or to execute in a loop (for example to make auto connect every time camera is up) run this:
```
./loop_camera.sh
```
## Original application replacement
As models I tested allow for remote access on telnet (using admin/admin credentials) you can simply replace original application by putting your webserver address in conf.sh file and running:
```
./install.sh IP_OF_CAMERA
```
After some setup (and 60 seconds delay) camera will start hosting out.jpg file with latest frame.
